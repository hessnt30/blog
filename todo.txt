### Current Features ###

# Focus
-------
- For now just make it a one account thing.
    - Bands make posts and people can see
      upcoming shows.
    - *not the best framework for adding all
       those features.


# How to verify band accounts?
-------------------------------
- Need to make it so only legit bands
  can make accounts. No trolls, but how?


#news.html
-----------
- move the huge script for displaying date into its own js file?
- make a style (css) sheet for this.


#Should we get rid of Comments?
------------------------------
Pros.
- Good way for bands to connect with other bands

Cons.
- Could have some issues with people spamming comments?
- Have to make a filter to eliminate profanity 


### Down the road add these features ###

#Two Different Types of Accounts
-------------------------------
- Band Account
    - Can make posts
    - How would we make sure not just anyone
    can make a band account?
    - Need to add a separate login? (Not ideal)
    - No likes/comments

- Listener Account 
    - Can't make posts
    - Can follow bands? 
        - only functionality are notifications (post notifications through Google texts/email D: )
    - Can like posts
    - Can comment (see line 5)


# Implement a hierarchal system for users
----------------------------------------
- Make a base User model in database
    - email, password, etc.
- Then make a band user and a listener user
  that are children of the User model.
