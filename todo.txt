-----------
- move the huge script for displaying date into its own js file?
- make a style (css) sheet for this.

#Should we get rid of Comments?
------------------------------
Pros.
- Good way for listeners to connect with bands

Cons.
- Could have some issues with people spamming comments?
- Have to make a filter to eliminate profanity 

#Two Different Types of Accounts
-------------------------------
- Band Account
    - Can make posts
    - How would we make sure not just anyone
    can make a band account?
    - Need to add a separate login? (Not ideal)
    - No likes/comments
    

- Listener Account 
    - Can't make posts
    - Can follow bands? 
        - only functionality are notifications (post notifications through Google texts/email D: )
    - Can like posts
    - Can comment (see line 5)

# Current issues
----------------
- Issues with is_Authorized function in views.py and auth.py.
    - Try catch did not work.
    - Overall issue is that I want to only show certain pages
      if a user is authenticated, but now that there are two
      types of accounts its tricky. (this issue is the if statement at base.html:29)
